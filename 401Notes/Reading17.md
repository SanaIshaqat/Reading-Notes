# Code 401 Class 17 Reading notes:


# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion


### Describe “The Cloud”

The cloud refers to servers accessed over the internet that store resources and software for computing and data storage.

### What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

A container is like a bundle containing an application and everything it needs to run.

### What is auto-scaling?

A cloud computing feature that allows cloud services to automatically scale based on traffic and utilization.

### What is bandwidth?

Bandwidth is how much data can be transferred by an entity such as a network or hardware.

### How do cloud providers compute service costs?

Bandwidth is how much data can be transferred by an entity such as a network or hardware.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Server Instances**

A single instance of a server when it is run on a machine or virtual machine.

**Containers**

A self contained environment that contains an application and all of its dependencies.

**Cloud Services**

Services provided by a cloud service provider such as computing resources and data storage.

**Cloud Architecture**

All of the cloud services used in a project such as databases and computing resources.

**AWS**

Amazon Web Services - a major cloud service provider.

**EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku**


EC2/Beanstalk is AWS's infrastructure solution for deploying software. Heroku is built off of these services and is more user friendly and simplified.

## Preparation Materials

### AWS S3
Object storage built to retrieve any amount of data from anywhere.
#### How it works

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can store and protect any amount of data for virtually any use case, such as data lakes, cloud-native applications, and mobile apps. 

### AWS Lambda Basics

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

- Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

### AWS Lambda Functions

AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications, and only pay for what you use.

### CDN

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

- CDNs work through servers nearest to the website visitor respond to the request. The content delivery network copies the pages of a website to a network of servers that are spread out at geographically different locations, caching the contents of the page.
