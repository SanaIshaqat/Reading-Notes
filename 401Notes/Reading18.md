# Code 401 Class 18 Reading notes:


# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### What are serverless functions?

Single-purpose, programmatic functions that are hosted on managed infrastructure. These functions, which are invoked through the Internet, are hosted and maintained by cloud computing companies.

### If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

You can use serverless functions or you could create a CL tool to locally run and remotely deploy your node.js applications.

### Describe how a CDN works

- CDNs work through servers nearest to the website visitor respond to the request. The content delivery network copies the pages of a website to a network of servers that are spread out at geographically different locations, caching the contents of the page.

- When a user requests a webpage that is part of a content delivery network, the CDN will redirect the request from the originating siteâ€™s server to a server in the CDN that is closest to the user and deliver the cached content.

## Preparation Materials



### AWS API Gateway

#### What is the AWS API gateway?

- Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. 

- Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications.

#### Why do we need AWS API gateway?

API Gateway provides WebSocket API management functionality such as the following: Monitoring and throttling of connections and messages.

### AWS DynamoDB

**DynamoDB** is an Amazon Web Services database system that supports data structures and key-valued cloud services. It allows users the benefit of auto-scaling, in-memory caching, backup and restore options for all their internet-scale applications using DynamoDB.

### Dynamoose

**Dynamoose** is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Dynamoose is heavily inspired by Mongoose, which means if you are coming from Mongoose the syntax will be very familar.
