## Document the Vocabulary Terms

**Rendering**

Rendering is a process used in web development that turns website code into the interactive pages users see when they visit a website. The term generally refers to the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes. The process is completed by a rendering engine, the software used by a web browser to render a web page.

**Templates**

A website template is a predesigned resource that shows the structure for the comprehensive layout and display features of any website. It is provided by various suppliers to help make Web design a lot easier for designers. A website template is also known as a Web page template or page template.

**State**

State is how something is; its configuration, attributes, condition or information content. We will use the term component to include software and hardware "things". Virtually all components have state, from applications to operating systems to network layers.


**Functional Components**

Functional components are basic JavaScript functions. These are typically arrow functions but can also be created with the regular function keyword. Sometimes referred to as “dumb” or “stateless” components as they simply accept data and display them in some form; that is they are mainly responsible for rendering UI.

**Children / Child Components**

Children allow you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop you use. The special thing about children is that React provides support through its ReactElement API and JSX. XML children translate perfectly to React children!

**State Hook**

State Hook The useState() is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components , it takes the initial state as an argument and returns an array of two entries.

**Mounting and Un-Mounting**

Mounting and Un-Mounting The main job of React is to figure out how to modify the DOM to match what the components want to be rendered on the screen. React does so by mounting (adding nodes to the DOM), unmounting (removing them from the DOM), and updating (making changes to nodes already in the DOM).
