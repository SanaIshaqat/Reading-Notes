### Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”

RTK follows the ducks pattern and combines reducers, actions, and constants in one file called a slice. Each slice will provide an initial state and a reducer function for an object in store. So our component that provides the data, which is a duck

### What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux Toolkit is beneficial to all Redux users regardless of skill level or experience.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**redux toolkit slices**

What is createSlice in Redux Toolkit? createSlice is a higher order function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions and a slice name. It automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.

**namespace**

What is the namespace?
A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it. Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple libraries.

### What is react native and how is it used?
React Native is an open-source JavaScript framework, designed for building apps on multiple platforms like iOS, Android, and also web applications, utilizing the very same code base. It is based on React, and it brings all its glory to mobile app development.

### Why react native is used?
React Native (also known as RN) is a popular JavaScript-based mobile app framework that allows you to build natively-rendered mobile apps for iOS and Android. The framework lets you create an application for various platforms by using the same codebase.

### Is react native frontend or backend?
React. js/React is an open-source frontend framework that is based on JavaScript, developed by Facebook, and best known for its virtual DOM feature. With React, we recommend Express. js/Express as a backend service.


### What framework is react native?
React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android. It's based on React, Facebook's JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms.

### What database is react native?
MongoDB For React Native. MongoDB is an open source, a server-side database that has been built for scalability and complex applications. MongoDB follows a combined approach of using key-value stores and a relational database to store objects in JSON documents with dynamic schemas. 

### What is Expo react native?

Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

### Why We Use Expo in React Native?
Expo is a toolchain built around React Native to help you quickly start an app. It provides a set of tools that simplify the development and testing of React Native app and arms you with the components of users interface and services that are usually available in third-party native React Native components.


### What's the difference between React Native and Expo?
Expo expands the API surface of React Native

React Native does not give you all the JS APIs you need out of the box, but only most primitive features. React Native developers are expected to use Android Studio/XCode to link additional native libraries.
