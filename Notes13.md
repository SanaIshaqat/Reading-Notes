## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding




### What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?
But here's a good starting place: The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.
### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. It became the story we told ourselves about the computing revolution. It helped define who geeks were, and it created techie culture.

## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

### When are diversity efforts most successful?
If we want to build more diverse tech organizations, then we need to hire a more diverse workforce. Hiring practices have a huge impact on the diversity of an organization. Oftentimes, organizations put their own barriers in the way of building a more diverse workforce with things like coding assessments, candidate prioritization, or resume scanning software.
### Why do diverse companies perform better?
because they reach-out to diverse clientele.
### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
We know that diversity matters. We know that companies and societies flourish when they are safe for all identities and when we listen to the wider range of human experience. Diversity is what fosters innovation and opens us up to new problems and ideas.
