## Java Script Expressions and operators: 

### Operators

JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.


* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Arithmetic operators
* Bitwise operators
* Logical operators
* String operators
* Conditional (ternary) operator
* Comma operator
* Unary operators
* Relational operators


### Assignment operators
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.


### Comparison operators
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.


### Arithmetic operators
An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. The standard arithmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). 


### Logical operators
Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value.


### String operators
In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.

### Conditional (ternary) operator
The conditional operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. The operator can have one of two values based on a condition.


### Comma operator
The comma operator (,) evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand. This operator is primarily used inside a for loop, to allow multiple variables to be updated each time through the loop.

### Unary operators
A unary operation is an operation with only one operand.

### Relational operators
A relational operator compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on whether the comparison is true.

## Loops 

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.
You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another.

### - For Loop
for(initial value; condition;counter){statement to repeat}
for(var i=1;i<=10;i++){console.log count}
### - While Loop

while(condition){statement to repeat}
while(y < 20) {console.log y+=1}
