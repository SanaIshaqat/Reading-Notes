## HTML & CSS:

**Images HTML:**

There are sveral ways to control how the image looks like in html "old methods" ( left, right, top, bottom) however it is prefered to use CSS for that.

**Three Rules for Creating Images**

1. Save image in the righ format.
Use GIF or PNG format when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color,Whenever you have many different colors in a picture you should use a JPEG.

2. Save the image at the right size.
The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.

3. Use the right resolution.
Images created for the web should be saved at
a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution
of the image, the larger the size of the file.

**Color Css:**

#### rgb values:
These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. 
For example: rgb(100,100,90)

#### hex codes:
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. 
For example: #ee3e80

#### color names:
There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. 
For example: DarkCyan

**Summary**

- Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

**Text CSS**

The formatting of your text can have a significant effect
on how readable your pages are.

- There are properties to control the choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.
- There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.
- If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.
- You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.
- You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.
