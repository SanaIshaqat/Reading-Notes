# Code 201 Class 10 Reading notes:

## HTML & CSS:

### CSS Images:

You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.

**Sizes that are commonly used on all pages:**

Small portrait: 220 x 360
Small landscape: 330 x 210
Feature photo: 620 x 400

**Aligning images using CSS:**

float property can be used
to move an element to the left or
the right of its containing block,
allowing text to flow around it.

**Centering images using CSS:**

Once it has been made into a
block-level element, there are
two common ways in which you
can horizontally center an image:

1: On the containing element,
you can use the **text-align**
property with a value of center.

2: On the image itself, you can
use the use the **margin** property
and set the values of the left and
right margins to auto.

**Background Images:**
The **background-image**
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.

The path to the image follows
the letters url, and it is put
inside parentheses and quotes.

**Repeating Images:**

**repeat**
The background image is
repeated both horizontally and
vertically (the default way it
is shown if the backgroundrepeat
property isn't used).

**repeat-x**
The image is repeated
horizontally only (as shown in
the first example on the left).

**repeat-y**
The image is repeated vertically
only.

**no-repeat**
The image is only shown once.
The background-attachment
property specifies whether a
background image should stay in
one position or move as the user
scrolls up and down the page. It
can have one of two values:

**fixed**
The background image stays in
the same position on the page.

**scroll**
The background image moves
up and down as the user scrolls
up and down the page.


### Summary:

- You can specify the dimensions o XX f images using CSS.
This is very helpful when you use the same sized
images on several pages of your site.

- Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
using CSS.

- You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page.

- Background images can appear just once or be
repeated across the background of the box.

- You can create image rollover effects by moving the
background position of an image.

- To reduce the number of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.


## Practical Information:

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**

In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords
(the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order
to improve its findability.

**1: Page Title**
The page title appears at the top
of the browser window or on the
tab of a browser. It is specified in
the < title> element which lives
inside the < head> element.

**2: URL / Web Address**
The name of the file is part of
the URL. Where possible, use
keywords in the file name.

**3: Headings**
If the keywords are in a heading
< hn> element then a search
engine will know that this page is
all about that subject and give it
greater weight than other text.

**4: Text**
Where possible, it helps to
repeat the keywords in the main
body of the text at least 2-3
times. Do not, however, over-use
these terms, because the text
must be easy for a human to
read.

**5: Link Text**
Use keywords in the text that
create links between pages
(rather than using generic
expressions such as "click here").

**6: Image Alt Text**
Search engines rely on you
providing accurate descriptions
of images in the alt text. This
will also help your images show
up in the results of image-based
searches.

**7: Page Descriptions**
The description also lives inside
the < head> element and is
specified using a < meta> tag.
It should be a sentence that
describes the content of the
page. (These are not shown in
the browser window but they
may be displayed in the results
pages of search engines.)
Never try to fool search engines!
They will penalize you for it. For
example, never add text in the
same color as the background of
the page as they can detect this.

**How to Identify Keywords and Phrases:**

Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the
hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that
will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site.

**Analytics: Learning about your Visitors**

As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing
how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are
leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by
Google called Google Analytics.

**How Many People Are Coming to Your Site?**

The overview page gives you a snapshot of the key information you are
likely to want to know. In particular, it tells you how many people are
coming to your site.

**What Are Your Visitors Looking At?**

The content link on the left-hand side allows
you to learn more about what the visitors are
looking at when they come to your site.

**Where Are Your Visitors Coming From?**

The traffic sources link on the left hand side
allows you to learn where your visitors are
coming from.

**Domain Names & Hosting**

In order to put your site on the web you will
need a domain name and web hosting.

**FT P & Third Party Tools**
To transfer your code and images from your
computer to your hosting company, you use
something known as File Transfer Protocol.

### Summary Pratical Information:

- Search engine optimization helps visitors find your
sites when using search engines.

- Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to
see how many people visit your site, how they find it,
and what they do when they get there.

- To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a
domain name and web hosting.

- FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your
local computer to your web server.

- Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email
newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website
tools (to save you writing them from scratch).
